Hey, I am **Aayush Ahuja**. This is my blog where I am wishing to share new experiences that I learn every day. 

I am currently working with [Groupon](http://groupon.com) in Chennai, India. I am a Computer Science Engineer from BITS-Pilani, Pilani Campus.


I was born and brought up in New Delhi, India. Was in Pilani, India was four years of engineering and now currently in Chennai. I am a former GSoCer, open source contributor and active on StackOverflow.

Things which make me hyperactive and full of energy - 
<ul>
<li>Design and then Code up a Complex Problem and then see it work!! The greatest joy ever!!</li>
<li>A correct dynamic programming submission :)</li>
<li>Gaming!! (Dota2)</li>
</ul>

Though my programming interests are not very specific, I have affinity towards writing low level C code. As a complete opposite my favorite language is Python, even though I think I can code in any language with ease. Developing some great thing is what I want to do! I have gained experience in the worlds of Java and AngularJS also. But probably nothing beats Python when I decide to code :)

I am also a foodie who loves eating Indian, Mughlai and Chinese food especially Chicken. I am also a decent cook, managing to make my own dinner everyday somehow. 

Please write to me in case you managed to read these lines, expressing your views and also get in touch. Always looking to learn new things from people I meet!
