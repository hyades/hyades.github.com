Hey, I am **Aayush Ahuja**. This is my blog where I am wishing to share new experiences that I learn every day. 

I am currently working with [Groupon](http://groupon.com) in Chennai, India. I am a Computer Science Engineer from BITS-Pilani, Pilani Campus. 


I was born and brought up in New Delhi, India. Was in Pilani was four years of engineering and now currently in Chennai.

Anyways, for now I'm just working toward changing the face of Electrical Engineering forever. Not that I necessarily expect to succeed, but it's something to strive for, and it's a fun problem to work on.

Things which make my adrenaline shoot off - 
<ul>
<li>Solving a problem after a really long time which was so daunting in start</li>
<li>Gaming!! (Dota2)</li>
<li>Gym</li>
<li>Cricket Matches (guess common with most Indians)</li>
</ul>

I am also a foodie who loves eating Indian, Mughlai and Chinese food especially Chicken. I am also a decent cook, managing to make my own dinner everyday somehow. 

Though my programming interests are not very specific, I have affinity towards writing low level C code. As a complete opposite my favorite language is Python, even though I think I can code in any language with ease. Developing some great thing is what I want to do!

Please write to me in case you managed to read these lines, expressing your views and also get in touch. Always looking to learn new things from people I meet!
